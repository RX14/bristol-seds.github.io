The launch of UBSEDS3 is planned for noon on 26th October 2014 ([UKHAS Launch Announcment](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/ukhas/Tzg2VEQuJ9w/LoL_P7tkEE0J)). The  [pico tracker](/pico-tracker/balloon/2014/08/01/pico-tracker.html) will be built into a paper plane and launched inside a High Altitude Balloon by the [MARSBalloon team](http://marsballoon.com/). When the balloon bursts, the paper plane will hopefully glide back down to earth.

Keep up to date with the launch on the on the MARSBalloon [Mission Page](http://marsballoon.com/elysium-2/) and [Twitter Feed](https://twitter.com/marsballoon)!

## The Pico Tracker

We've made several improvements since the last launch:

* GPS module is upgraded from a uBlox 6 to a uBlox 8 chipset, and now uses the standard [MAX-M8C](http://www.u-blox.com/en/gps-modules/pvt-modules/max-m8-series-concurrent-gnss-modules.html) with an external wire antenna.
* The radio is fitted with a Temperature Controlled Oscillator (TCXO) for much better frequency stability.
* The MCU enters sleep mode when inactive to save power.
* The internal temperature of the radio is reported.
