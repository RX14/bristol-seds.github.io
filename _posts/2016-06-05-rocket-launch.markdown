For 2015-2016 academic year Bristol SEDS built the second G-Class model rocket named Whitebird Heavy to compete in the National Rocketry Competition

The rocket carried two payloads: an experiment to test the vibration damping characteristics of two different materials and an HD camera

The Lil Blackbird rocket was also launched. A new payload was designed for it this year, which contaned a pair of accelerometers with logging equipment.
The Open Rocket simulator predicted the peak acceleration during launch to be around 19g, which is outside of the range of most accelerometers.
ADXL345 accelerometer was used to get high precision g-force values inside its range of 16g and ADXL377 accelerometer (205g range) was used to cover the rest of the values.
Arduino Nano with a MicroSD card adapter was used to log the data.
