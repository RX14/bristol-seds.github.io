UBSEDS6 was our first launch using a [36" Qualatex Balloon](http://randomsolutions.co.uk/Random_Aerospace/Balloons.html). Despite
a bumpy ascent over Bristol the balloon super-pressured and floated at
about 8.6km. Favourable winds carried the balloon to Latvia before the
tracker failed 14 hours into the flight.

### Pre-stretching

The balloon was "pre-stretched" before flight but pumping air into the
balloon using a slightly modified [Omron M2](http://www.omron-healthcare.com/eu/en/our-products/blood-pressure-monitoring/m2) Blood Pressure
Monitor. While in flight the balloon experiences about 2kPa of
internal super-pressure at 8.5km float (this figure is a vague guess)
the balloon was inflated to a pressure of 4.7kPa on the ground
(measured as 35mmHg on the Omron M2).

<a href="/assets/flights/6/ubseds6_inflate_20mmhg_35mmhg.gif" target="_blank">Gif of the balloon inflating from 2.7kPa to 4.7KPa.</a> This takes about 2 hours.

The difference between the balloon at the start and end of the process
is very noticable. One of the slides below shows an un-modified
balloon on the left and a pre-stretched envelope on the right.

## Float

During the day the balloon entered a very stable float at about 8.6km
altitude and dropped to a similarly stable float at 8.2km during the night.

## Tracker

No major changes since last launch. The cause of tracker failure is
unknown, but possibly due to cold (-30ÂºC).
