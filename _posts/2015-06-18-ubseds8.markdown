UBSEDS8 was our second launch with a
[36" Qualatex Balloon](http://randomsolutions.co.uk/Random_Aerospace/Balloons.html). After
breifly appearing to enter a float at 9.3km, this flight continued to
slowly ascend, eventually reaching 11.2km. This is possibly a record
for the highest flight with a Qualatex balloon.

### Pre-stretching

This envelope was pre-stretched slightly more than UBSEDS6, eventually reaching an internal pressure of 4.9kPa as measured on the [Omron M2](http://www.omron-healthcare.com/eu/en/our-products/blood-pressure-monitoring/m2).

### Tracker

This flight enabled APRS tracking outside of countires that disallow
airbourne APRS operation. However no packets were heard, possibly due
to the output power being too low. More investiagion required.

The output voltage swing from the TCXO on this board seemed
particularly low, and it would not drive the MCU input. The TCXO is
normally used by the MCU for symbol timing and to measure the TCXO
drift against GPS, but for this flight the MCU used its internal
oscillator. The frequency of the internal oscillator is only specified
to Â±2.5% and this error in the symbol timing prevented Contestia from
decoding except at high SNRs. RTTY appeared to be unaffected.

The tracker failed about 4 hours into the flight. This didn't appear
to be related to low temperatures.
