The UBSEDS16 balloon was built from 50 micron thick PA-EVOH-PE
multilayer film and was 1.5 meters in diameter. The payload weight,
including insulation, was 58 grams. We aimed for 25 grams of free lift
to give a slightly higher ascent rate than usual, and the helium fill
resulted in 26.5 grams of free lift. This initial float altitude was
10.6km (35,000 ft).

The flight was intended to test the superpressure balloon with a heavier payload.

# Tracker

The tracker was build mostly from spares, and used a leftover PCB from
UBSEDS10 and 11.

# Transmissions

The balloon transmits approximately once every 30 seconds.

### UHF 434.6MHz

It uses the error-correcting Contestia 16/1000 mode on 434.612.5MHz USB.
