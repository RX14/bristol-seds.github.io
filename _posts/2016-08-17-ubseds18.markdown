The UBSEDS18 balloon was built from 50 micron thick PA-EVOH-PE
multilayer film and was 1.5 meters in diameter. The payload weight was
18 grams, and the free lift was 15.4 grams. The balloon was pre-stretched more
than previous flights.

The flight initially floated at 13.1km altitude (43,000 ft).

# Tracker

The tracker was built using a leftover PCB from UBSEDS10 and 11. It is
mostly powered from solar panels, so it only operates during daylight hours.

As well as two solar panels, the tracker also has a
[LIC1235R](http://www.mouser.com/ds/2/396/taiyoyuden_capacitor03_e-890446.pdf)
40F li-ion supercapacitor. The tracker isn't particularly power
efficient, so this supercapacitor only provides about an extra hour of
runtime in the evening.

# Transmissions

The balloon transmits approximately once per minute.

### UHF 434.6MHz

It uses the error-correcting Contestia 16/1000 mode on 434.612.5MHz USB.
