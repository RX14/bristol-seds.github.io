The UBSEDS17 balloon was built from 50 micron thick PA-EVOH-PE
multilayer film and was 1.9 meters in diameter. This is 0.4m more than
the usual 1.5m diameter. The larger size meant the longest axis of the
balloon and payload combined was more than 2 meters, and so a NOTAM
was required and obtained for the launch.

The payload weight was 25 grams, and the free lift was 15.8 grams.

The flight reached 11.4km before the envelope burst, and it landed in
Kent.

# Tracker

The tracker was similar to that used for UBSEDS15, but with an
additional 400mW amplifier section for APRS on 145.825 MHz. This was
never used in flight becuase the balloon did not leave the UK (where
airbourne AR is not permitted).

# Transmissions

The balloon transmits approximately once every 30 seconds.

### UHF 434.6MHz

It uses the error-correcting Contestia 16/1000 mode on 434.612.5MHz USB.
