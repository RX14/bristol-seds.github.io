In recent months the society has been working to build a "pico" tracker based on the concept pioneered by others in the [UKHAS](http://ukhas.org.uk) community. We're aiming to make a tracker that is 10x lighter and 10x cheaper than the board we flew on [BUSEDS1](/balloon/2014/06/15/hab-launch.html). The first board revision flew on 31st August 2014 as [UBSEDS2](/pico-tracker/balloon/launch/2014/08/31/ubseds2.html), and more flights are planned.

You can find more technical details on the [project page](/pico-tracker).
