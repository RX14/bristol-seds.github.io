UBSEDS7 was launched on Wednesday 17 June on board
[MARSBallon Firestar](http://marsballoon.com/firestar-is-go/).  The
tracker was intended be used to ensure the MARSBalloon science
experiments could be located at the end of the flight and safely
returned to schools across the UK.

However the launch team didn't remove the "Remove Before Flight" tag
on the tracker, and therefore it was inactive for the entire
flight. However, the payload has been located and hopefuly UBSEDS7
will fly again on a future launch.

More technical details about the tracker are available on the [project page](/pico-tracker).
