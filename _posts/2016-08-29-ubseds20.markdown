The UBSEDS20 balloon was built from 50 micron thick PA-EVOH-PE
multilayer film and was 1.9 meters in diameter. This is 0.4m more than
the usual 1.5m diameter. The larger size meant the longest axis of the
balloon and payload combined was more than 2 meters, and so a NOTAM
was required and obtained for the launch.

The balloon carried two payloads. UBSEDS19 was the backup tracker
(mass 13 grams), and UBSEDS20 was the main Raspberry Pi Zero payload
(mass 62 grams). The free lift was about 25 grams.

The initial float altiude was 12.5km. Given the total payload weight
of 75 grams, we believe this is easily the heaviest amateur
superpressure float to date.

## Tracker

This was the first test of our [pico-pi board](https://github.com/bristol-seds/pico-pi-rel).
