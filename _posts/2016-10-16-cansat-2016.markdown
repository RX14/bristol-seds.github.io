Bristol SEDS started off the new academic year with the University of Bristol's first ever CanSat competition

<!--more-->

The primary objective for the five competing teams was to log the temperature and pressure data during the cansat's descent using the qbcan kits provided, transmit it to a ground station over radio and present the altitude/time and temperature/altitude graphs.
The teams were free to choose the secondary payload and there was a variety of ideas: from a camera to an onboard wind turbine.
Despite a tight schedule - the teams had only one week to build their cansats - everybody managed to achieve great results.
