Bristol SEDS started off the new academic year with the University of
Bristol's first ever CanSat competition!

<!--more-->

The primary objective for the five teams competing was to log the
temperature and pressure data during the CanSat's descent using the
qbcan kits provided, and transmit it to a ground station over radio
and present the altitude/time and temperature/altitude graphs. The
teams were free to choose the secondary payload and there was a
variety of ideas: from a camera to an onboard wind turbine.  Despite a
tight schedule - the teams had only one week to build their CanSats -
everybody managed to achieve great results.

The event was organised with help from the University's
[Aerospace Engineering Department](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/engineering/departments/aerospace/)
and the Avionics Group.

# Data Collected

The teams presented plots of the data collected from their
[BMP180 temperature and pressure sensor](https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/bst/products/all_products/bmp180). The
altitude was calculated from the pressure values.
