For 2014/2015 Bristol SEDS produced a model rocket with a scientific payload, to compete with model rockets submitted by other UKSEDS branches as part of the National Rocketry Challenge NRC. Our scientific payload will test different methods for measuring altitude and will also study Doppler shift for a fast moving, vertical object.

The current launch date for our rocket is Sunday 4th of October. All new members of the society for 2015 are welcome to join in and help with final preparations for launch and also attend the launch of the Rocket which will be conducted with a Rocketry club in South Wales. We aim to build another G class model rocket in 2015/2016 as well!
