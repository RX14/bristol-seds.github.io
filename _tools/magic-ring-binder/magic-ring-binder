## Magic Ring Binder?

Magic Ring Binder is a tool for turning a flight on
[habitat](habitat.habhub.org) into a post for the website. The name is
inspired by aircraft pilots who, despite flying amazingly complex
machines capable of detailed logging, record their flights in a
paper ring binder. This is our ring binder, except ours is magic.
